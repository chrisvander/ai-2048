# AI 2048

A project built for a few purposes:
1. Give me a fun way to play 2048 in the terminal
2. Learn a bit more about Rust
3. Practice building different algorithms for AI game agents.

See the fruits of my labor. Ensure you have [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs), clone this repository and `cd` into it, and run:
```sh
cargo run --release
```

It'll pull dependencies, build the project, and start it! Use arrow keys and enter to control the menu and game, and tap "q" at any point to exit.
